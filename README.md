â†» UNDER CONSTRUCTION     

The data used is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). All additional information below is fictional.

## Business Problem
Rossmann is a pharmacy chain that operates over 3,000 stores in 7 European countries. The stores are going to be renovated and the CFO needs to know how much can be invested in each one of them.    
The Data Scientist was requested to develop a sales prediction mode that forecast the sales for the next 6 weeks for each store. Therefore, the telegram bot must return this sales prediction for the given store.    

## Business Assumptions
* The data available is only from 2013-01-01 to 2015-07-31.
* Stores without information on distance from competitors are considered without competition nearby.
* For stores with no information about when the competitor opened, it was assumed that either the store does not have a nearby competitor, or the store has a nearby competitor but it is not known when it opened.
